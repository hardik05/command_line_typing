[SHORT]
What a beautiful day it is on the beach, here in beautiful and sunny Hawaii.
We climbed to the top of the mountain in just under two hours; isn’t that great?
All the grandfather clocks in that store were set at exactly 3 o’clock.
Caught between a rock and a hard place.
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
